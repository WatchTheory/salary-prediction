## Run The Project


1.Clone the repository

2.Install dependencies
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run Jupyter 
```python
jupyter notebook data_cleaning.ipynb
```
Also runs in google colab
- Download the notebook `ipynb` file 
- Upload file 
- Run All cells


## What I'd Improve with  more Time
Run through claude
- Build a proper salary prediction model 
- Generate more syntic data for forecast model
- Geographic cost-of-living normalization
- Data Cleaning using SQl
